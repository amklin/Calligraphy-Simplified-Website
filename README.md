## Website Description

The website introduces a user who may be interested in learning Chinese to the language and writing system. It demonstrates various uses of Chinese characters, both in historical texts and modern day slang. Through a built-in canvas feature, the user can practice their Chinese writing skills by tracing Chinese characters, improving their ability to write Chinese characters properly and neatly. The user can also create an account, which will allow their drawings to be saved for them to come back to in the future.
